Members: Laura Catano, Immanuel Vattakunnel, Alex Nyamweya


Ace Drive is an online car rental system designed to provide clients easier access to personal vehicles. Our software allows users to rent cars from any of our wide variety of locations, making the process of renting, calculating expenses, and returning cars as simple as possible. Once registered with our software, a user can select a car from a variety of makes, models, and pickup locations to rent. They can define the amount of time they need the car for, and once the expiration date is reached they can easily return their car. The application also tracks gas and maintenance details, to ensure that each car is in proper operating condition when it is picked
